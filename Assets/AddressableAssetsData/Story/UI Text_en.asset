    m_Localized: "     The Kingdom of Astra was once a peaceful and prosperous land,
      where vast fields and thriving villages had stood in harmony for centuries.
      However, one fateful day, a horde of mysterious and ferocious monsters emerged
      from the depths of the dark forests, bringing with them shadows and terror
      that engulfed the entire kingdom.\r\n\r\n     These creatures did not only
      ravage everything in their path but also invaded Astra's territories, threatening
      the very existence of the kingdom. Faced with relentless and fierce attacks,
      the soldiers of Astra had to abandon their peaceful lives and enter a constant
      state of battle. Always on high alert, they faced wave after wave of monstrous
      assaults, defending every inch of Astra's land and fighting for the survival
      of its people.\r\n\r\n     Under the darkened skies, the roars of the beasts
      echoed from all directions, but the brave warriors of Astra remained undeterred.
      They knew that even a moment of carelessness could spell the end for their
      beloved kingdom. And so, with swords ready and spears held firm, they vowed
      to fight to the last breath to protect their land from the shadows that were
      slowly creeping over it."
